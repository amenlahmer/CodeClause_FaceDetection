# FaceDetection-
The project I undertook was focused on developing an efficient and accurate face detection system using a pretrained YOLOv5 model on the WIDER Face dataset. The primary goal was to leverage the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to identify and localize faces in images and videos.
